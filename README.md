# Naive-Bayes-SVM
This code implements the NB-SVM from the paper:  Sida Wang and Christopher D. Manning: Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification; ACL 2012. http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf

Quote from the above paper "NBSVM performs well on snippets and longer documents, for sentiment, topic and subjectivity classification,
and is often better than previously published results. Therefore, NBSVM seems to be an appropriate and very strong baseline for sophisticated methods aiming to beat a bag of features."
